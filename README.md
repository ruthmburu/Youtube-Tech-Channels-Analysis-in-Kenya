# Youtube-Tech-Channels-Analysis-in-Kenya
This project aims to analyze Top 5 YouTube Tech channels in Kenya using Python. The analysis focuses on various aspects such as video data, subscriber trends, and engagement metrics.
# Overview
YouTube has become a prominent platform for content creators in Kenya, with channels covering diverse topics ranging from entertainment, education, news, and more. This project focuses on the top 5 tech channels and how understanding the performance and dynamics of these channels can provide valuable insights for creators, marketers, and researchers.
# Objectives
* Get the top 5 Kenyan Tech YouTube channels.
* Get basic channel information (creation date, number of videos, description, subscribers etc.)
* Identify video details of every channel (title, description, duration, views, likes..)
* Identify trends in subscriber growth and engagement metrics.
* Explore correlations between content types and engagement levels.
* Visualize findings to facilitate easy interpretation and decision-making.
# Dataset
The analysis utilizes a dataset comprising metadata from the 5 Kenyan YouTube channels, including information on video titles, descriptions, upload dates, view counts, likes, dislikes, comments, and subscriber counts. The dataset is collected using the YouTube Data API and stored in CSV format.
# Methodology
1. Data Collection: Utilize the YouTube Data API to fetch channel and video data for analysis.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the raw data, including handling missing values and standardizing formats.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of various metrics, identify outliers, and explore correlations.
4. Content Analysis: Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze video titles and descriptions.
5. Subscriber Trends: Analyze subscriber growth patterns over time and identify factors influencing growth.
6. Engagement Metrics: Calculate engagement metrics such as likes, dislikes, comments, and view-to-engagement ratios.
7. Visualization: Visualize key findings using matplotlib, seaborn, and other Python libraries for effective communication.
